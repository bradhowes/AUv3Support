# Pirkle

This folder holds source code from https://www.willpirkle.com/Downloads/fxobjects_1.1.zip It is used to evaluate my
implementation of DSP algorithms discussed in Will Pirkle's excellent book
"Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++" [2019]. However, none of this code is included in any of the products generated
by this package.
